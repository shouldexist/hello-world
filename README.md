# hello-world
my first repository. created to help me learn github. not sure if it will have any life beyond a learning exercise...only time will tell :) 

if you're wondering a bit about me or what i do, my handle @shouldexist will also find me on twitter. it's short for "things that should exist" - which, coincidentally, is also my website: www.thingsthatshouldexist.com 

feel free to head over there to find out about the most recent batch of things that should exist (at least, in my addle-brained opinion). there are no actual guarantees of existence, only strongly held opinions in support thereof.

drop me a line if you think there are some other things that should exist that may or may not yet.
