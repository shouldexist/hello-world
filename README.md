# hello-world
My first repository. Created to help me learn Github. Not sure if it will have any life beyond a learning exercise...only time will tell :) 

If you're wondering a bit about me or what I do, my handle @shouldexist will also find me on Twitter. It's short for "things that should exist" - which, coincidentally, is also my website: www.thingsthatshouldexist.com 

Feel free to head over there to find out about the most recent batch of things that should exist (at least, in my addle-brained opinion). There are no actual guarantees of existence, only strongly held opinions in support thereof.

Drop me a line if you think there are some other things that should exist that may or may not yet.
